# Aesthetic To-Do List Web App

This is a modern To-Do List web application I developed. It features task management with add, complete, and delete functionalities. The app supports dark and light themes with a toggle button.

The background has a subtle pixelated effect with colors that change smoothly and frequently, creating an aesthetic vibe. Floating icons related to to-do lists morph shapes, move, and change colors continuously.

## Features

- Add, complete, and delete tasks
- Dark and light theme toggle
- Animated pixelated background with smooth color transitions
- Floating morphing icons that change shape, position, and color

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Canvas API for animations

## How to Use

Open the `index.html` file in a modern browser. Add tasks, toggle completion by clicking on tasks, delete tasks with the button, and toggle themes with the theme button.
